# K-Means-Clustering-for-Minute-Weather-Data-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to perform K-means clustering on minute-granularity weather data using scikit-learn in Python. The goal is to generate a big-picture model of the weather patterns at a local station by grouping similar data points into clusters.
